## UN Sustainable Development Goals And Targets
___
### SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

![SDG 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63765620/228413156-ab24326d-a560-44bf-a506-529c435ab41b.png)

> 3.4.1 - preventing the deaths from cardiovascular diseases, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases.

> 3.8 - Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.
### SDG 9: Quality Education

![SDG 9](ReadMeFiles/SDGReport2022_Goal9infographic.png)

> 9.5 - Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries, including by 2030, encouraging innovation and substantially increasing the number of research and development workers per 1 million people and public and private research and development spending.

- This app can contribute to achieving universal health coverage by providing patients with access to quality health care services through their mobile devices
- Developing this app would require scientific research and the use of innovative technologies, which aligns with this target. 
- We chose these goals because we ourselves have witnessed cases where the lack of automated processes and quality technology in health care affects thousands.
